1. for preloaded simulations, upload it to the right directory in the server
    DONE
2. list all simulations, both live and preloaded
    DONE
3. replace local storage with session storage (needed for restarting simulation)
    DONE
4. add a "is restart", this should only be true after clicking the restart button 
    DONE
5. enable the restart button after starting a simulation
    DONE
6. check if we can still get a preloaded simulation from the backend
    DONE
7. check if we can still launch a simulation (live)
    DONE --> Polylines seems still buggy though
8. replace the stuff that uses directly the session storage
    DONE
8. make make sure that the simulator knows if the simulation is either
    1. live simulation --> server always involved
    2. preloaded, from server
    3. preloaded, not from server
    DONE
9. rename data to temp-sim-data and update app.ts
    DONE
10. for simulations that do not originate from server: upload that stuff to the tmp data folder
    DONE
11. be able to run a saved simulation on backend
    1.  unzip
        DONE
    2.  get stops file
        DONE
12. know when it is a restart
    1.  DONE (?)
